# Deep_Learning_Internship_Works

I took part in a series of studies from the creation of a dataset of an artificial intelligence model that can categorize a given website to the optimization of hyperparameters:

- The features that could be included in the dataset were determined.
- Data was collected from the websites for these features determined from the websites previously obtained for each category value.
- The dataset to be used in model training was prepared with this data.
- Data preprocessing was done before the model training phase.
- The model was trained with the processed and edited dataset.
- Hyperparameters were optimized to improve the accuracy of the model.
