en,abortion,https://www.who.int/health-topics/abortion,Abortion | World Health Organization (WHO),Abortions are safe if they are done with a method recommended by WHO that is appropriate to the pregnancy duration and if the person providing or supporting the abortion is trained. Such abortions can be done using tablets (medical abortion) or a simple outpatient procedure.

en,abortion,https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/09-03-2022-who-releases-new-guidelines-on-safe-abortion,WHO releases new guidelines on safe abortion,"WHO has released new guidelines on abortion care in a bid to protect the health of women and girls and help prevent over 25 million unsafe abortions that currently occur each year around the world. Based on the latest scientific evidence, these consolidated guidelines bring together over 50 recommendations spanning clinical practice, health service delivery, and legal and policy interventions to support quality abortion care. When carried out according to WHO guidelines, abortion is a simple and safe health intervention. The new guidelines will support access to comprehensive and quality abortion care within national health systems in the WHO European Region and globally. New recommendations to improve access to high quality, person-centred servicesWhen carried out using a method recommended by WHO, abortion is a safe procedure. Tragically, however, only half of all abortions take place under such conditions, with unsafe abortions causing around 39 000 deaths globally. Most of these deaths are in lower-income countries – with over 60% in Africa and 30% in Asia – and among those living in the most vulnerable situations.  The new guidelines include recommendations on many simple interventions at the level of primary care that: improve the quality of abortion care provided to women and girls; include task-sharing by a wider range of health workers; ensure access to medical abortion pills, which mean more women can obtain safe abortion services; and ensure that accurate information on care is available to all those who need it. For the first time, the guidelines also include recommendations for the use of telemedicine where appropriate, which has helped support access to abortion and family planning services during the COVID-19 pandemic.Removing unnecessary policy barriers facilitates access to safe abortionAlongside the clinical and service delivery recommendations, the guidelines recommend removing medically unnecessary policy barriers to safe abortion, such as criminalization, mandatory waiting times, the requirement that approval must be given by other people (such as partners or family members) or institutions, and limits on when during pregnancy an abortion can take place. Such barriers can lead to critical delays in accessing treatment and put women and girls at greater risk of unsafe abortion, stigmatization and health complications, while increasing disruptions to their education and ability to work.   Evidence shows that restricting access to abortions does not reduce the number of abortions that take place. In fact, restrictions are more likely to drive women and girls toward unsafe procedures. In countries where abortion is most restricted, only 1 in 4 abortions is safe, compared to nearly 9 in 10 in countries where the procedure is broadly legal.  Instead, studies in several European countries have shown that long-term national sexuality education programmes have led to a reduction in teenage pregnancies and abortions.Following this launch, WHO/Europe will support interested countries to implement the new guidelines and strengthen national policies and programmes related to contraception, family planning and abortion services, helping them provide the highest standard of care for women and girls. Updated guidelinesThe WHO abortion care guidelines update the former edition, released in 2012, and consolidate existing and new recommendations.An interactive online database containing comprehensive information on the abortion laws, policies, health standards and guidelines for all countries is available via the link below.

Studies have found that creative messages get more attention and lead to positive attitudes about the products, but there’s little evidence linking those messages to purchase behavior. To address this gap, Reinartz and Saffert developed a consumer survey approach that measures perceived creativity along five dimensions—originality, flexibility, elaboration, synthesis, and artistic value—and applied the approach in a study of 437 TV ad campaigns for 90 fast-moving consumer goods brands in Germany. The study then linked the assessments to sales figures for the products. The findings confirm that creative campaigns are, in general, more effective than other types of ads. The research also shows that the various creativity dimensions deliver different results. Elaboration, for instance, had a far more powerful effect on sales than did originality, a more commonly used dimension. Indeed, many companies focus on the wrong dimensions in their campaigns. This article reveals which product categories are best suited to creative advertising and which dimensions of creativity have the most influence on sales."

These leaders are placed squarely in the political arena with other political elites, including elected officials, and this study uses a common agency framework to describe the ways in which leaders should be expected to leverage their own personal preferences in guiding their organization’s behavior. Using data from a unique survey of nonprofit leaders in California, I measure the ways that a leader’s personal values and characteristics – specifically their political ideology on a left-right spectrum – have an effect on the organization’s advocacy efforts. Results indicate that political ideology is related to whether or not a leader identifies their group as one that engages in political or policy issues, and what types of tactics they use."

Early nurses advocated for professional nurses’ value and knowledge and fought for implementation of best practices, safety measures, and other quality improvements. Florence Nightingale advocated for practice changes that improved environmental conditions in health care and reduced life-threatening infections by using data to support her recommendations.

This volume outlines a new agenda for the study of advocacy organizations, proposing a model of NGOs as collective actors that seek to fulfil normative concerns and instrumental incentives, face collective action problems, and compete as well as collaborate with other advocacy actors. The analogy of the firm is a useful way of studying advocacy actors because individuals, via advocacy NGOs, make choices which are analytically similar to those that shareholders make in the context of firms. The authors view advocacy NGOs as special types of firms that make strategic choices in policy markets which, along with creating public goods, support organizational survival, visibility, and growth. Advocacy NGOs' strategy can therefore be understood as a response to opportunities to supply distinct advocacy products to well-defined constituencies, as well as a response to normative or principled concerns."

Despite the lack of evidence for adverse effects on mental health stemming from psychedelic use, concerns persist regarding the capacity of these substances to modulate information processing and attitudes towards factual data. The aim of the present study was to investigate the propensity for accepting alternative facts and the general treatment of knowledge within a sample of 392 participants, 233 of whom reported at least a single incidence of psychedelic use in their lifetime. To do this, we leveraged step-wise methods of linear modelling investigating effects of demographics, psychiatric conditions and concomitant drug use. Our findings revealed a moderate positive association between psychedelic use and beliefs in alternative facts, as well as the specific belief that facts are politically influenced. However, no links were found for favouring intuition over evidence when confirming facts. Among other investigated drugs, only alcohol was negatively associated with beliefs in alternative facts. Taken together, our results support the link between psychedelic use and non-conformist thinking styles, which can be attributed to the psychological effects of the drugs themselves, but may also mirror a common trait related to unconventional beliefs and illicit substance use."

Insights into <b>beliefs</b> and preferences for e ...,"Alternative fuels made from biomass or CO2 and water using renewable energy can reduce CO2 and pollutant emissions compared to fossil-based mobility and thus support a transition to a more sustainable transport. The adoption of alternative fuels in transport will ultimately depend on public acceptance and drivers’ willingness to use them. Little is known if and under which circumstances people would accept alternative fuels and which narratives and cognitive beliefs might underlie these usage intentions. Moreover, it is unclear if and how laypeople distinguish between different alternative fuel types in their perceptions, e.g., between fuels made from biomass (biofuels) and fuels produced using electricity (e-fuels). To address the research gap, this study empirically investigated laypeople’s beliefs and expectations towards alternative fuels and preferences for different fuel types. Understanding preferences for fuel types could help in steering public information, support managerial decisions and communication pathways, and promote the roll-out process of fuel innovations. Laypeople expected alternative fuels to be made using renewable feedstocks and to not contain gasoline or diesel. Whereas alternative fuels were believed to have advantages concerning environmental and toxic effects and safety compared to diesel and gasoline, they were associated with practical disadvantages for drivers. It was shown that although e-fuels and biofuels both fall under the definition of ”alternative fuels”, laypeople distinguish between them in evaluations of safety, costs, and resource competitiveness: E-fuels were preferred over biofuels and believed to have a lower competition for resources than biofuels. They were also evaluated to be more expensive and comparably less safe to use. Moreover, different adopter groups were identified for both fuels. The study has highlighted both adoption drivers and barriers for alternative fuels: Reduced environmental impact could be an important positive factor. In contrast, drawbacks feared by laypeople regarding a low range and an expensive fuel price could be barriers for alternative fuel adoption because they reflect current technical challenges for these fuels. Thus, a more cost-efficient production and higher fuel efficiency should be considered in an acceptance-optimized alternative fuel production."
en,alternative_beliefs,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/4/837,Stakeholder <b>Beliefs</b> about <b>Alternative</b> Proteins: A Systematic Review,"In recent years, a great deal of research has been conducted on consumers’ attitudes and beliefs in favor and against alternative proteins (AP). By contrast, a much more limited research effort has been devoted to understanding stakeholders’ point of view. The current work provides a first systematic review of the existing literature on stakeholders’ beliefs towards alternative protein sources. Moreover, a secondary content analysis was carried out on the selected studies, providing an overview of the major themes emerging from the existing literature in relation to utilitarian, normative, and control beliefs that stakeholders hold towards AP. Results showed that stakeholders’ beliefs are very different from those that emerged from previous research on consumers’ views. Overall, stakeholders appear much more aware, compared to consumers, of the implications of using alternative proteins in relation to the main pillars of sustainability (economic, environmental, social). Stakeholders’ beliefs were grouped into 13 categories, such as “economics”, “consumers”, and “rules”. With respect to future scenarios, they attribute an important role to political institutions, with respect to both economic and communication aspects, which they consider crucial to overcome persistent consumer skepticism."

Despite three decades of public health promotion based on the scientific explanation of HIV/AIDS, alternative explanations of the disease continue to circulate. While these are seen as counter-productive to health education efforts, what is rarely analysed is their plurality and their tenacity. This article analyses the ‘AIDS myths’ collected by African HIV/AIDS workplace peer educators during an action research project. These beliefs about HIV/AIDS are organised, in this article, around core ideas that form the basis of ‘folk’ and ‘lay theories’ of HIV/AIDS. These constitute non-scientific explanations of HIV/AIDS, with folk theories drawing on bodies of knowledge that are independent of HIV/AIDS while lay theories are generated in response to the disease. A categorisation of alternative beliefs about HIV/AIDS is presented which comprises three folk theories — African traditional beliefs, Christian theology, and racial conspiracy — and three lay theories, all focused on avoiding HIV infection. Using this schema, the article describes how the plausibility of these alternative theories of HIV/AIDS lies not in their scientific validity, but in the robustness of the core idea at the heart of each folk or lay theory. Folk and lay theories of HIV/AIDS are also often highly palatable in that they provide hope and comfort in terms of prevention, cure, and the allocation of blame. This study argue that there is coherence and value to these alternative HIV/AIDS beliefs which should not be dismissed as ignorance, idle speculation or simple misunderstandings. A serious engagement with folk and lay theories of HIV/AIDS helps explain the continued circulation of alternative beliefs of HIV/AIDS and the slow uptake of behavioural change messages around the disease."

Being able to identify their presence and recognize the factors characterizing their endorsement is crucial to understanding their prevalence. In this preregistered study, we validated the English version of the Pseudoscience Endorsement Scale and investigated its correlates. A group of volunteers (n = 510), representative of the U.S. population, responded to this scale and to questionnaires measuring the presence of paranormal, denialist, and conspiracist beliefs. The validation resulted in a shorter version of the scale, the sPES. Participants also completed a scientific literacy questionnaire as well as bullshit detection and cognitive reflection tests. Scores obtained on the questionnaires corresponding to different unwarranted beliefs correlated with each other, suggesting a possible common basis. Scientific knowledge, cognitive reflection scores, and bullshit sensitivity were negatively associated with scores on the pseudoscience scale. Of note, bullshit receptivity was the main contributor in a model predicting pseudoscience endorsement."

 Previous research suggests that people may develop stronger causal illusions when the existence of a causal relationship is consistent with their prior beliefs. In the present study, we hypothesized that prior pseudoscientific beliefs will influence judgments about the effectiveness of both alternative medicine and scientific medicine. Participants (N = 98) were exposed to an adaptation of the standard causal illusion task in which they had to judge whether two fictitious treatments, one described as conventional medicine and the other as alternative medicine, could heal the crises caused by two different syndromes. Since both treatments were completely ineffective, those believing that any of the two medicines worked were exhibiting a causal illusion. Participants also responded to the Pseudoscience Endorsement Scale (PES) and some questions about trust in alternative therapies that were taken from the Survey on the Social Perception of Science and Technology conducted by FECYT. The results replicated the causal illusion effect and extended them by revealing an interaction between the prior pseudoscientific beliefs and the scientific/pseudoscientific status of the fictitious treatment. Individuals reporting stronger pseudoscientific beliefs were more vulnerable to the illusion in both scenarios, whereas participants with low adherence to pseudoscientific beliefs seemed to be more resistant to the illusion in the alternative medicine scenario."

en,child_abuse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK195987/,New Directions in <b>Child Abuse</b> and Neglect Research.,"Since the 1993 National Research Council (NRC) report on child abuse and neglect was issued, dramatic advances have been made in understanding the causes and consequences of child abuse and neglect, including advances in the neural, genomic, behavioral, psychologic, and social sciences. These advances have begun to inform the scientific literature, offering new insights into the neural and biological processes associated with child abuse and neglect and in some cases, shedding light on the mechanisms that mediate the behavioral sequelae that characterize children who have been abused and neglected. Research also has expanded understanding of the physical and behavioral health, academic, and economic consequences of child abuse and neglect. Knowledge of sensitive periods—the idea that for those aspects of brain development that are dependent on experience, there are stages in which the normal course of development is more susceptible to disruption from experiential perturbations—also has increased exponentially. In addition, research has begun to explore differences in individual susceptibility to the adverse outcomes associated with child abuse and neglect and to uncover the factors that protect some children from the deleterious consequences explored throughout this chapter. An important message is that factors relating to the individual child and to the familial and social contexts in which the child lives, as well as the severity, chronicity, and timing of abuse and neglect experiences, all conspire to impact, to varying degrees, the neural, biological, and behavioral sequelae of abuse and neglect."

en,child_education,https://ijccep.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40723-021-00084-8,Fostering socio-<b>emotional learning through early childhood intervention</b>,"Educators and researchers are increasingly interested in evaluating and promoting socio-emotional learning (SEL) beginning in early childhood (Newman &amp; Dusunbury in 2015; Zigler &amp; Trickett in American Psychologist 33(9):789–798 https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.33.9.789 , 1978). Decades of research have linked participation in high-quality early childhood education (ECE) programs (e.g., public prekindergarten, Head Start) to multidimensional wellbeing. ECE programs also have demonstrated potential to be implemented at large scales with strong financial returns on investment. However, relatively few studies have investigated the effects of ECE programs on SEL, particularly compared to smaller-scale, skills-based SEL interventions. Furthermore, among studies that have examined SEL, there is a general lack of consensus about how to define and measure SEL in applied settings. The present paper begins to address these gaps in several ways. First, it discusses conceptual and methodological issues related to developmentally and culturally sensitive assessment of young children’s socio-emotional functioning. Second, it reviews the empirical research literature on the impacts of three types of early childhood programs (general prekindergarten programs; multi-component prekindergarten programs; and universal skills-based interventions) on SEL. Finally, it highlights future directions for research and practice."

BTK is also involved in the regulation of Toll-like receptors and chemokine receptors. Given the central role of BTK in immunity, BTK inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Great efforts have been made in developing BTK inhibitors for potential clinical applications in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This review covers the recent development of BTK inhibitors at preclinical and clinical stages in treating these diseases. Individual examples of three types of inhibitors, namely covalent irreversible inhibitors, covalent reversible inhibitors, and non-covalent reversible inhibitors, are discussed with a focus on their structure, bioactivity and selectivity. Contrary to expectations, reversible BTK inhibitors have not yielded a significant breakthrough so far. The development of covalent, irreversible BTK inhibitors has progressed more rapidly. Many candidates entered different stages of clinical trials; tolebrutinib and evobrutinib are undergoing phase 3 clinical evaluation. Rilzabrutinib, a covalent reversible BTK inhibitor, is now in phase 3 clinical trials and also offers a promising future. An analysis of the protein–inhibitor interactions based on published co-crystal structures provides useful clues for the rational design of safe and effective small-molecule BTK inhibitors."

This Review discusses the molecular biology of BTK, its involvement in the pathogenesis of B cell malignancies and the current efforts to therapeutically target it. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key component of B cell receptor (BCR) signalling and functions as an important regulator of cell proliferation and cell survival in various B cell malignancies. Small-molecule inhibitors of BTK have shown antitumour activity in animal models and, recently, in clinical studies. High response rates were reported in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma. Remarkably, BTK inhibitors have molecular effects that cannot be explained by the classic role of BTK in BCR signalling. In this Review, we highlight the importance of BTK in various signalling pathways in the context of its therapeutic inhibition."

Iterative advances in the cat and mouse game of resistance and redesign have moved BTK inhibitors from covalent to non-covalent and now targeted protein degraders. However, contrary to the presumption that protein degraders may be impervious to mutations in BTK, we now present clinical evidence that a mutation in the kinase domain of BTK, namely A428D, can confer disease resistance to a BTK degrader currently in clinical trials, that is BGB-16673. Modeling of a BTK A428D mutation places a negatively charged aspartic acid in place of the hydrophobic side chain of alanine within the binding pocket of another BTK-degrader in clinical development, namely NX-2127, suggesting that CLL cells with BTK A428D also may be resistant to NX-2127, as they already are known to be with either non-covalent or covalent inhibitors of BTK. Consequently, the two BTK degraders furthest advanced in clinical trials potentially may select for CLL cells with BTK A428D that are resistant to all approved BTKi’s."

However, on-target BTK mutations facilitating evasion from BTK inhibition lead to resistance that limits the therapeutic efficacy of BTK inhibitors. In this study we employed structure-based drug design strategies based on established BTK inhibitors and yielded a series of BTK targeting compounds. Among them, compound S-016 bearing a unique tricyclic structure exhibited potent BTK kinase inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.5 nM, comparable to a commercially available BTK inhibitor ibrutinib (IC50 = 0.4 nM). S-016, as a novel irreversible BTK inhibitor, displayed superior kinase selectivity compared to ibrutinib and significant therapeutic effects against B-cell lymphoma both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we generated BTK inhibitor-resistant lymphoma cells harboring BTK C481F or A428D to explore strategies for overcoming resistance. Co-culture of these DLBCL cells with M0 macrophages led to the polarization of M0 macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, a process known to support tumor progression. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that SYHA1813, a compound targeting both VEGFR and CSF1R, effectively reshaped the tumor microenvironment (TME) and significantly overcame the acquired resistance to BTK inhibitors in both BTK-mutated and wild-type BTK DLBCL models by inhibiting angiogenesis and modulating macrophage polarization. Overall, this study not only promotes the development of new BTK inhibitors but also offers innovative treatment strategies for B-cell lymphomas, including those with BTK mutations."

Surprisingly, some of these functions can even be antagonistic, often letting to divergent functional outcomes depending on microenviromental cues and tissue/cell type-dependent parameters. Lately, the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has emerged as one of such pleiotropic genes, with opposing effects in cancer pathways. While it has long been considered oncogenic in the context of B cell malignancies, recent data shows that BTK can also act as a tumour suppressor in other cells, as an essential member of the p53 and p73 responses to damage. Since BTK inhibitors are already being used clinically, it is important to carefully review these new findings in order to fully understand the consequences of blocking BTK activity in all the cells of the organism."

Ibrutinib was the first BTK inhibitor to be approved, and it changed the standard-of-care treatment for diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia, improving efficacy outcomes and safety compared to chemotherapy. In this article, we review the development of zanubrutinib, a next-generation BTK inhibitor, from molecular design to patient-related outcomes. We start this journey by providing insights into the discovery of BTK and the physiologic, genetic, and molecular characterization of patients lacking this kinase, together with the brief treatment landscape in the era of chemo-immunotherapies. Zanubrutinib was originally developed by applying a structure-activity strategy to enhance the specificity as well as enzymatic and pharmacokinetic properties. Preclinical studies confirmed greater specificity and better bioavailability of zanubrutinib compared with that of ibrutinib, which supported the initiation of clinical trials in humans. Preliminary clinical results indicated activity in B-cell malignancies together with an improved safety profile, in line with less off-target effects described in the preclinical studies. The clinical program of zanubrutinib has since expanded significantly, with ongoing studies in a wide range of hemato-oncological diseases and in combination with many other therapies. Zanubrutinib currently is approved for various B-cell malignancies in multiple countries. This story highlights the importance of multidisciplinary collaborative research, from bench to bedside, and provides an example of how the commitment to finding improved treatment options should always run parallel to patient care."

One of the most diabolical serial killers in American history was forgotten to the ages. In the 1970s, Dennis Rader, the self-titled BTK (Bind’em, Torture’em, Kill’em), terrified Wichita, Kansas with his horrifying murders. And then, just like that , he vanished. In 2004, he reemerged from his self-exile, and a year later he was behind bars for crimes that were barely remembered outside longtime Wichita residents. His desire for attention was a fascinating look inside the mind of a serial killer. How he became such a monster is an important case study to prevent others from taking his dark passage.

Following his presentation, we hear from distinguished speakers, Natalia Miteva, Deputy Minister of Education and Science of Bulgaria, and João Costa, former Minister of Education of Portugal and current Chairperson of the OECD Education Policy Committee, who offer their unique perspectives. The session concludes with a live Q&A where we’ll also hear from Lucie Cerna, Senior Analyst at the Equity, Inclusion & Transitions project and get her thoughts on the importance of this year’s EAG focus, equity."

While some research suggests that exposure to sexually explicit material (SEM) among adolescents and college students is associated with sexually violent behavior, our understanding of this relationship is limited. This study aimed to assess the relationship between prior exposure to several types of SEM and sexually violent behavior in a sample of first-year university men in Vietnam.   Methods and findings A cohort of 739 first-year male university students completed three survey waves over 14 months, providing information on contact and non-contact sexually violent behavior, exposure to SEM, and other theorized confounders of the SEM-SV relationship. Controlling for these covariates, we estimated the average treatment effect of SEM on contact and non-contact SV using the propensity score method. We also conducted a dose-response analysis for the effect of violent SEM on SV based on frequency-of-exposure classes derived from latent class analysis. The majority of the sample reported exposure to SEM in the prior six months, with 41% of the sample reporting exposure to violent SEM. In propensity-adjusted models, exposure to violent SEM, but not other types, had a small but significant positive effect on contact and non-contact SV. These effects increased for frequent viewers of violent SEM. Models of contact SV showed endogeneity, warranting caution.   Conclusions Exposure to violent SEM is prevalent among university men in Vietnam and may be contributing to sexually violent behavior. Incorporating media literacy into SV prevention programs to mitigate these potential effects may be warranted."

en,explicit_violence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK349101/,Self-Harm as Violence: When Victim and Perpetrator Are One,"My aim in this chapter is to challenge this conception of suicide and especially self-harm, arguing that in central instances, it is on the one hand straightforwardly a form of violence, and, on the other, no more pathological than central instances of other-directed violence. Different people self-harm for different reasons, but given a realistic under-standing of the psycho-socio-economic context which women who self-harm typically face, it emerges as fully comprehensible behaviour – an instrumental means to ends that, given the context, we can understand why women would have. In other words, self-harm emerges as a form of, broadly speaking, rational agency. As Anna Motz eloquently puts one component of this idea: ‘To deny female violence is to deny female agency’ (Motz 2008, 71). But to pathologize female violence is also to deny female humanity and rationality – to deny the way that aggression can be as natural for women to feel as it is for men, and that violence in women can function, as it does in men, not only to express aggression but also to serve various ends that embody clear and recognizable goods. This recognition is essential if we are to respond to self-directed violence in ways that are both effective and ethically appropriate."

en-US,explicit_violence,https://www.imdb.com/list/ls071877835/,List of <b>the Most Violent and Disturbing Movies Ever</b> (18+) - IMDb,"Blood, violence and depravity are themes that’ve shown up in our artwork for thousands of years. The thrill of watching gladiators torn apart in battle was once a popular form of recreation. Indeed, during the times of barbarism and cavemen, the law of the land was kill or be killed. Mankind’s bloodlust, it would seem, is old as mankind itself. Our methods for pandering to it may have changed, but our repressed, savage desires have not. There’s no denying that the survival instincts of our ancestors remain with us to this day. So, how is one to satisfy their twisted cravings? What outlets exist? The answer: simulation.Before the rise of disturbing artistry in film, audiences got their fix in the form of live theater. One such theater, the Grand Guignol, was among the first of its kind to depict acts of rape, torture and dismemberment before a voyeuristic live audience. The Grand Guignol shocked and horrified a generation of Europeans in the heart of Paris, from 1897 until its closing in 1962. By then, the advent of cinema was in full swing. Live theater had taken a backseat to the incredible, booming popularity of the big screen. It wouldn’t be long before underground films began surfacing in video collections. These films defied the conventions and boundaries set by such milestone pictures as Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho and George A. Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. Foreign directors like Ruggero Deodato and Hideshi Hino would produce “senseless and depraved” motion pictures, a few of which would go on to become cult hits. In response, the movie-going public turned the other cheek, and Hollywood studios continued to play it safe. The market for cinema’s dark underbelly was still finding its feet. By the early 1970s, the envelope was pushed much further. The enormous gap between Hollywood studios and underground filmmakers was bridged by the controversial works of directors like Stanley Kubrick. During this time, the public eye began to shift from disgust to marginal acceptance. Fearing the economic threat posed by taboo subject matter, the industry resisted. Kubrick’s 1971 film, A Clockwork Orange, would be withdrawn from release in response to accusations that the picture had inspired real life rape and murder. Mainstream censorship wasn’t going down without a fight. It wouldn’t be until the 1980s that the slasher movement introduced audiences to gratuitous onscreen violence and gore. At this point in time, major studios like Paramount Pictures and New Line Cinema were getting behind such gruesome flicks as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. The legacy these iconic films carried with them would set the standard for things to come thereafter. Given the context of its history, the world of disturbing film has come a long way. Throughout its evolution, a small handful of works have pushed boundaries to such an extent and in so unique a fashion that they occupy a class all their own. With this in mind, Taste of Cinema proudly presents a list of the Top Twenty Most Disturbing Films of All Time. Each picture has been selected based on culture impact, lasting appeal and shock factor, relative to the context of its time of release. Let’s begin, shall we?"

The motivational typology presented in the chapter distinguishes between the intention to threaten and the commitment to act. The commonest threats in everyday life are the expletive screams. These threats may also reflect a preexisting angry or fearful state of mind and presage further aggression, though not necessarily against the person threatened. Threateners whose intention is to shield themselves are, if anything, committed to avoiding violence. Those who intend to shock are using the threat as a weapon to cause distress. Those who threaten to signal their commitment to enact are sending a clear warning that produces apprehension in even the most stoic. Those who scheme, coerce action through menacing behavior. Given that any threatener can escalate to violence, all threats need to be taken seriously and assessed carefully. Management reduces the commitment to violence and challenges the choice to threaten."

A handful of these are definitely not for the squeamish, faint of heart, or those that are easily-offended or overly-sensitive. Nobody under the age of 17 should be permitted (at least for a good chunk of these films). It may sound strange but some of them are somewhat kid or teen friendly in a way and not just for adults so the ratings in general do vary somewhat (depending upon your region or country's rating system I mean). This in particular usually goes for the ones on here that are NR or Unrated.

However for any entry with an R-rating, it is because there is either both an Unrated/R rated edit... more or less, the original X rating was changed after sometime. Which is why I'm also including a handful of films (from all different genres) that were initially rated X or NC-17 when they first came out. Good luck finding some of these though as more than a couple dozen are actually considered to be lost unfortunately! As a side note, a good portion of the movies  on here are also banned in multiple countries, if not heavily censored at the very least. Also there are numerous films on here that are simply Not Rated (for whatever reason) and are of all different genres. Not to mention I must stress that these NR movies also significantly vary in what they contain and thus could considered to be for general audiences, or your average cinema goer compared to the latter while some films could easily be banned in quite a few other countries just for what is shown in them (even nowadays). 

Also as an FYI, I honestly haven't seen everything I've included on here just yet so the end result of it will definitely vary from person to person... especially if it is NR/Unrated but please keep an open mind because a handful of some of the best movies that have ever been made are all on this list. Although it should go without saying that most of these films aren't for everyone, but if you do have a strong stomach and a taste for the macabre, provocative, or outlandish then you have come to the right place! Whatever you do, just don't trust the IMDB rating average since it can get pretty misleading and rather inaccurate half the time."

We investigated the relationship of implicit and explicit memory to a range of symptoms in a sample of 27 women with exposure to chronic interpersonal violence (IPV). Participants viewed the first 3 letters (""stems"") of trauma-related, general threat, and neutral words; valenced words were matched with neutral words with the same stem. Free recall and a word-stem completion task were used to test explicit and implicit memory, respectively. Participants exhibited increased implicit memory for trauma-related words as compared with both general threat words and neutral ""match"" words. They also showed increased explicit memory for both general threat and trauma-related words. Finally, although neither implicit nor explicit memory was correlated with PTSD symptoms, implicit memory for trauma-related words was significantly correlated with symptoms associated with ongoing IPV. Interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and alexithymia were significantly correlated with implicit, but not explicit, memory for trauma words. Somatization, dissociation, and alexithymia were negatively correlated with explicit, but not implicit, memory for general-threat words. These findings suggest that memory processes in survivors of IPV are closely related to the symptom profile associated with complex trauma. Exploring memory processes in survivors of IPV may lend unique insight into the development and maintenance of the symptom profile associated with IPV."

en,file_sharing_and_storage,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/14/5100,Blockchain Private <b>File</b> <b>Storage</b>-<b>Sharing</b> Method Based on IPFS,"Under the current national network environment, anyone can participate in publishing. As an important information resource, knowledge files reflect the workload of publishers. Moreover, high-quality knowledge files can promote the progress of society. However, pirated inferior files have the opposite effect. At present, most organizations use centralized servers to centrally manage the knowledge files released by users. In addition, it is necessary to introduce an untrusted third party to examine and encrypt the contents of files, which leads to an opaque process of file storage transactions, tampering with intellectual copyright, and the inability to have consistent systems of file management among institutions due to the lack of uniform standards for the same intellectual files. The purpose of this paper is to ensure the safe storage of knowledge files on the one hand and to realize efficient sharing of copyrighted files on the other hand. Therefore, this paper combines NDN (Named Data Network) technology with a distributed blockchain and an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and proposes a blockchain knowledge file storage and sharing method based on an NDN. The method uses the NDN itself for the file content signature and encryption, thereby separating the file security and transmission process. At the same time, the method uses a flexible NDN reverse path forwarding and routing strategy, combining an IPFS private storage network to improve the safety of the encrypted data storage security. Finally, the method takes advantage of all participating nodes consensus and shares files in the synchronized blockchain to ensure traceability. This paper introduces the structure and principles of the method and describes the process of file upload and transfer. Finally, the performance of the method is compared and evaluated, and the advantages and disadvantages of the method and the future research direction are summarized."

In this research, we evaluated the association between financial inclusion and the performance of banks in Palestine using dynamic panel analysis applied to a sample of 11 banks, with two econometric models representing profitability indicators over a nine-year period (2012–2020). In addition to linear regression models, the generalized method of moments estimator was utilized. The results showed that access to financial services (e.g., the number of automated teller machines (ATMs) and the number of bank branches), service delivery (including the average costs to maintain a current account), and the quality of the products improve banks’ profitability. However, point-of-sale terminals have no impact on profitability. Additionally, financial service utilization reflected in bank account number sand credit to small and medium-sized enterprises do not affect bank profitability, and among bank-specific variables, the nonperforming loan ratios, the cost-to-income ratios, and liquidity were found to be the main drivers of profitability. Policymakers in Palestine must prioritize FI by adopting rules that encourage lending to practices of financial institutions."

The survey discovered four main research trends: the first trend shown is “Financial Inclusion and Corporate Governance in Islamic Fintech”. The second trend focuses on “information technology and future financial Islamic services”. The third trend is “The Transformation of Islamic Finance: How Fintech is Changing the Game”. The fourth trend is related to “Islamic Finance: A Growing Force in the Digital Age”.

It draws on the classical theory of banking and the literature on digital transformation. It provides an explanation for existing trends and, by extending the theory of the banking firm, it illustrates how financial intermediation will be impacted by innovative financial technology applications. It further reviews the options that established banks will have to consider in order to mitigate the threat to their profitability. Deposit taking and lending are considered in the context of the challenge made from shadow banking and the all-digital banks. The paper contributes to an understanding of the future of banking, providing a framework for scholarly empirical investigation. In the discussion, four possible strategies are proposed for market participants, (1) customer retention, (2) customer acquisition, (3) banking as a service and (4) social media payment platforms. It is concluded that, in an increasingly digital world, trust will remain at the core of banking. That said, liquidity transformation will still have an important role to play. The nature of banking and financial services, however, will change dramatically."

However, a detailed survey of the applications of deep learning in finance and banking is lacking in the existing literature. This study surveys and analyzes the literature on the application of deep learning models in the key finance and banking domains to provide a systematic evaluation of the model preprocessing, input data, and model evaluation. Finally, we discuss three aspects that could affect the outcomes of financial deep learning models.

Evidence of these harms is limited to small-sample, cross-sectional self-reports, such as prevalence surveys. We examine the association between gambling as a proportion of monthly income and 31 financial, social and health outcomes using anonymous data provided by a UK retail bank, aggregated for up to 6.5 million individuals over up to 7 years. Gambling is associated with higher financial distress and lower financial inclusion and planning, and with negative lifestyle, health, well-being and leisure outcomes. Gambling is associated with higher rates of future unemployment and physical disability and, at the highest levels, with substantially increased mortality. Gambling is persistent over time, growing over the sample period, and has higher negative associations among the heaviest gamblers. Our findings inform the debate over the relationship between gambling and life experiences across the population. Using financial data from 6.5 million individuals, Muggleton et al. find that gambling, at all levels, is associated with financial distress, unemployment, disability and higher mortality, with stronger associations amongst the heaviest gamblers."

Is Europe the center of the Christian world? Is India a Hindu nation? While decades ago these questions were often answered in the affirmative, the truth has never been that simple. Not only are adherents of particular faiths spread across the globe, but there are many variations of a particular faith practiced side by side. This has only become more true in recent years as the pace of globalization has quickened. The essays collected here provide brief and accessible introductions to the major world religions in their global contexts. The volume begins with an introduction to the globalization of religion by Mark Juergensmeyer, and is followed by individual essays on Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and local religious societies. The book concludes with three essays reflecting on the global religious scene. Taken together, these essays provide a concise, authoritative, and highly readable introduction to the state of worldwide religion in the 21st century."

Its main intention is to de-center European epistemologies of religion by drawing out a more intricate global and plural genealogy. This is a very complex endeavour, however, especially when one leaves the realm of academic debate and considers the quotidian understandings of “religion” emerging in colonial encounters. Here one is often confronted by vast entanglements of practices, perceptions and politics, which need a historical methodology that foregrounds the plurality, complexity and historicity of all religious epistemes. Drawing on Deleuze’ and Guattari’s philosophical figure of the rhizome, this article sketches such an approach in a conversation between theory and historiographical practice, as it maps out a particular episode in the construction of “political Islam” in German East Africa."

Globalization is affecting religions in complex ways. It can both strengthen religions through the spread of ideas and weaken them by promoting pluralism and cultural mixing. Some see globalization as eroding traditional religious communities and values, causing people to turn more strongly to religion for stability. However, globalization has also increased religious tolerance by exposing common values across faiths and enabling interfaith cooperation on issues like development goals. While globalization increases religious competition and identity-based conflicts in some cases, religious organizations also work for global peace by promoting interfaith dialogue and religious nonviolence."

In each section an introductory essay discusses the social development of that religious tradition historically. The other essays cover the basic social factsthe communitys size, location, organizational and pilgrimage centers, authority figures, patterns of governance, major subgroups and schismsas well as issues regarding boundary maintenance, political involvement, role in providing cultural identity, and encounters with modernity. Communities in the diaspora and at the periphery are covered, as well as the central geographic regions of the religious traditions.

This accords them a major role in societal processes, aincluding current global challenges as spelled out in the 17 SDGs, the core of the Agenda 2030. After decades of neglect, recent years have seen a rise in interest in the role of religion in the public agenda. Academics, policymakers and practitioners alike increasingly acknowledge the significance of faith actors for the SDGs. Key terms such as “Common Home”, shared by faith and secular actors, already indicate their mutual relevance. At the same time, there is a lack of religious literacy in recognizing and interpreting religious dimensions in a given development context. This paper therefore seeks to shed light on the often nebulous “religious factor” in the SDGs in two consecutive steps. At first, the historical part traces the rise of religion in development. In the second step, an analytical part then provides a seven-dimensional model to enhance religious literacy and to provide a better understanding of both the potential and the problems of religion in the global quest for implementing the SDGs."

Key terms like “religion”, “media”, “publicness” and “scholarship” can be understood and articulated differently in different social, cultural and geographical locations, and dialogue across our academic contexts is needed to help explore these parallels and divergences. This article shares three reflections from scholars who have lived and worked in west Africa, southern Europe and south-east Asia. Each contributor has been asked to address two questions: How do religious communities engage public audiences? And how can (or should) scholars communicate with the public? The conclusion to the article identifies some of the central themes of their responses: secularity, colonial legacies, globalization, power, vulnerability, and the intended audience of our public interventions."

Key terms like “religion”, “media”, “publicness” and “scholarship” can be understood and articulated differently in different social, cultural and geographical locations, and dialogue across our academic contexts is needed to help explore these parallels and divergences. This article shares three reflections from scholars who have lived and worked in west Africa, southern Europe and south-east Asia. Each contributor has been asked to address two questions: How do religious communities engage public audiences? And how can (or should) scholars communicate with the public? The conclusion to the article identifies some of the central themes of their responses: secularity, colonial legacies, globalization, power, vulnerability, and the intended audience of our public interventions."

Understandings of religion have been fundamentally transformed since the nineteenth century. The respective contradictions, ambiguities, continuities, and ruptures can be most comprehensively grasped when viewed against the background of global entanglements. For this purpose, the approach of global religious history proposes a range of theoretical and methodological tools. Its theoretical repertoire is largely informed by a critical engagement with poststructuralist epistemology and postcolonial perspectives embedded in a consistent genealogical approach. At the outset, it aims at bridging divisions, including those between postcolonial and global history, between disciplines such as religious studies and history, as well as between different area studies. This implies a theoretically robust reflexion of the question of what global entanglements mean in global religious history, along with the question of how to distinguish global religious history from approaches usually qualified by the prefix trans as, for example, in “transregional.” In this introduction, we offer an in-depth discussion of the theoretical foundations and methodological implications of global religious history."

In those countries favouring social democracy, the government owns or regulates business and industry. Even in the free-market economy of the United States—where there remains a much greater attachment than in most societies to the idea that government should be only an umpire adjudicating the rules by which other forces in society compete—some level of government regulation,"

These hybrid organizations (e.g., Fannie Mae, National Park Foundation, In-Q-Tel), collectively referred to in this report as the quasi government, have grown in number, size, and importance in recent decades. A brief review of executive branch organizational history is followed by a description of entities with ties to the executive branch, although they are not agencies of the United States as defined in Title 5 of the U.S. Code. Several categories of quasi governmental entities are defined and discussed: (1) quasi official agencies; (2) government-sponsored enterprises (GSE); (3) federally funded research and development corporations; (4) agency-related nonprofit organizations; (5) venture capital funds; (6) congressionally chartered nonprofit organizations; and (7) instrumentalities of indeterminate character. The quasi government, not surprisingly, is a controversial subject. To supporters of this trend toward greater reliance upon hybrid organizations, the proper objective of governmental management is to maximize performance and results, however defined. In their view, the private and governmental sectors are alike in their essentials, and thus subject to the same economically derived behavioral norms. They tend to welcome this trend toward greater use of quasi governmental entities. Critics of the quasi government, on the other hand, tend to view hybrid organizations as contributing to a weakened capacity of government to perform its fundamental constitutional duties, and to an erosion in political accountability, a crucial element in democratic governance. They tend to consider the governmental and private sectors as being legally distinct, with relatively little overlap in behavioral norms."

These QGOs pose distinct conceptual and policy challenges that differ from those of traditional government entities or purely private nonprofits. Drawing on a convenience sample of five such QGOs incorporated in one metropolitan region (Greater Cleveland, Ohio), this piece explores potential reasons for, and possible pitfalls of, mixing private organizational legal status with public-affiliated leaders by developing a framework and proposing a research agenda for future study."

However, the statement of non-profit organisations is more complicated than simply comparing them to the government, as they may also suffer from a lack of resources and ineffective management, just like the government. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role and impact of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) towards Sustainable Community Development in and to identify the challenges these organisations face. Method: Throughout this investigation, a wide range of sources from academic journals, reports, and even company websites were consulted to gather data. This article includes data on the number of NGOs in Malaysia, which can help us obtain a better sense of the sector. To find out just how rapidly these non-profits are expanding, the project’s goal is to track their progress. A systematic literature review method was used to screen the retrieved articles from three online databases. Findings: Eight articles have been chosen for further analysis in this study. In total, four challenges and four recommendations have been identified. Conclusions: To that end, this article offers some suggestions for improving already-existing non-profit organisations so that they serve the community as a whole."

The expansion of human rights raises important new issues for society, such as who should be held accountable for decisions. In contrast to traditional representative democracy, grassroots democracy expands civil rights and liberties and holds citizens more accountable at the local level. Concurrently, it generates some potential benefits for social development, both for the individuals who take part in it and for society as a whole. This study examines the experience of nations worldwide in implementing grassroots democracy and grassroots governance mechanisms. It makes an effort to evaluate the potential and prospects of legal conceptualisation of the concept of grassroots governance and adaptation of personal self-governance systems in terms of the social growth of communities."

The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, in each of which a national government claims to exercise sovereignty—or the power of final authority—and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. This fact of the world’s political organization suggests the distinction employed in the following section among supranational, national, and subnational political systems.    The formation of supranational relationships is a principal result of the division of the world into a number of separate national entities, or states, that have contact"

NGOs are considered to be major role players in this era of governance as; in some instances, they fill the vacuum created by governments’ inability to honor the social contract, particularly in developing countries. However, the role of NGOs in the development process does not come easily, as they are faced with a number of challenges and opportunities. The purpose of this chapter is to examine the changing roles of NGOs in development, focusing on the case of a country like South Africa. Using a qualitative method, the chapter relies on a review of the available literature on the roles of NGOs in developing countries with a specific reference to South Africa. Explanatory case studies are considered to ascertain the role NGOs play in development. Specific cases of NGOs operating in local government in South Africa are examined with the aim of highlighting their contribution to the development and also identifying some of the challenges and opportunities available to them. The chapter concludes by suggesting some avenues that could be explored to enhance the role of NGOs in development in South Africa."

en,health_and_wellness,https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-well-being,Promoting well-being - World Health Organization (WHO)," Well-being is a positive state experienced by individuals and societies. Similar to health, it is a resource for daily life and is determined by social, economic and environmental conditions. Well-being encompasses quality of life and the ability of people and societies to contribute to the world with a sense of meaning and purpose. Focusing on well-being supports the tracking of the equitable distribution of resources, overall thriving and sustainability. A society’s well-being can be determined by the extent to which it is resilient, builds capacity for action, and is prepared to transcend challenges (Glossary of Terms 2021).   WHO works with Member States and partners to advance well-being as it pertains to global health and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Well-being is a major underlying driver of policy coherence across sectors and encourages galvanized action. Advancing societal well-being helps create active, resilient and sustainable communities at local, national and global levels, enabling them to respond to current and emerging health threats such as COVID-19 and environmental disasters.WHO coordinated the 10th Global Conference on Health Promotion in December 2021, where the Geneva Charter for Well-being was endorsed by participants. It outlines 5 key action areas:   design an equitable economy that serves human development within planetary      boundaries; create public policy for the common good; achieve universal health coverage; address the digital transformation to counteract harm and disempowerment and to      strengthen the benefits; and value and preserve the planet.  WHO continues to work with Member States to implement actions in these areas. "

Some criticized this definition as being excessively broad, vague, and unmeasurable, and in subsequent years health care focused more on a biomedical reductionist model than on achieving that more holistic vision of health. In 1984 the WHO revisited and updated the definition of health, shifting it from a desirable state of being to a dynamic set of resources for living well—“the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs to change or cope with the environment . . . health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective”—that emphasized the social and personal resources as well as physical capabilities that are a part of health (WHO, 1984, p. 34)."

One major theme in this has been the shift toward multidimensional approaches over reliance on traditional metrics such as single measures (e.g. happiness, life satisfaction) or economic proxies (e.g. GDP). To produce a cohesive, multidimensional measure of well-being useful for providing meaningful insights for policy, we use data from 2006 and 2012 from the European Social Survey (ESS) to analyze well-being for 21 countries, involving approximately 40,000 individuals for each year. We refer collectively to the items used in the survey as multidimensional psychological well-being (MPWB). The ten dimensions assessed are used to compute a single value standardized to the population, which supports broad assessment and comparison. It also increases the possibility of exploring individual dimensions of well-being useful for targeting interventions. Insights demonstrate what may be masked when limiting to single dimensions, which can create a failure to identify levers for policy interventions. We conclude that both the composite score and individual dimensions from this approach constitute valuable levels of analyses for exploring appropriate policies to protect and improve well-being."

The Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence in collaboration with the Faas Foundation conducted a national survey of more than 14,500 employees across industries to better understand how Americans experience work. The sample represented the U.S. economy in the distribution of industries represented and demographic diversity. In this survey the authors found that 23% of workers reported experiencing unethical behavior. While it often goes undiscovered, this behavior puts too many businesses – and, unknowingly, their customers – at risk."

So how can they determine when they’re inching toward dangerous territory? There are three main psychological dynamics that lead to crossing moral lines. First, there’s omnipotence: when someone feels so aggrandized and entitled that they believe the rules of decent behavior don’t apply to them. Second, consider cultural numbness: when others play along and gradually begin to accept and embody deviant norms. Finally, when people don’t speak up because they are thinking of more immediate rewards, we see justified neglect. There are several strategies leaders can use to counter these dynamics, including relying on a group of trusted peers to keep you in check, keeping a list of things you will never do for profit, and looking out for ways you explain away borderline actions."

The typical response from policy makers is to propose a patchwork of reforms to address various corporate transgressions. But by and large, these reforms focus on preventing gross and blatant violations of the law – and they ignore the more banal, ordinary acts of unethicality that are far more common in organizations. Numerous studies have documented the prevalence of practices such as stealing office supplies, inflating business expenditures reports, and engaging in behaviors that raise conflicts of interest. While these may sound negligible, these violations reduce trust over time and alter prevailing business and legal norms. Their aggregated effect can be quite harmful. Behavioral ethics research suggests that this type of misconduct occurs not because people are unethical or deliberately choose to act unethically, but because they fail to understand that their behavior is indeed unethical and can have harmful consequences. Thus, sanctioning rule breaking and looking for “smoking guns” will not prevent most employees from acting unethically. If organizations want to do a better job at preventing misconduct, they need to adopt a two-stage approach. The first stage focuses on increasing people’s awareness of the illegality and unethicality of their behavior. The second stage is about ensuring that employees clearly recognize that misconduct will be penalized."

en,illegal_or_unethical,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01147-y,Beyond safety: mapping the ethical debate on heritable genome editing ...,"Genetic engineering has provided humans the ability to transform organisms by direct manipulation of genomes within a broad range of applications including agriculture (e.g., GM crops), and the pharmaceutical industry (e.g., insulin production). Developments within the last 10 years have produced new tools for genome editing (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9) that can achieve much greater precision than previous forms of genetic engineering. Moreover, these tools could offer the potential for interventions on humans and for both clinical and non-clinical purposes, resulting in a broad scope of applicability. However, their promising abilities and potential uses (including their applicability in humans for either somatic or heritable genome editing interventions) greatly increase their potential societal impacts and, as such, have brought an urgency to ethical and regulatory discussions about the application of such technology in our society. In this article, we explore different arguments (pragmatic, sociopolitical and categorical) that have been made in support of or in opposition to the new technologies of genome editing and their impact on the debate of the permissibility or otherwise of human heritable genome editing interventions in the future. For this purpose, reference is made to discussions on genetic engineering that have taken place in the field of bioethics since the 1980s. Our analysis shows that the dominance of categorical arguments has been reversed in favour of pragmatic arguments such as safety concerns. However, when it comes to involving the public in ethical discourse, we consider it crucial widening the debate beyond such pragmatic considerations. In this article, we explore some of the key categorical as well sociopolitical considerations raised by the potential uses of heritable genome editing interventions, as these considerations underline many of the societal concerns and values crucial for public engagement. We also highlight how pragmatic considerations, despite their increasing importance in the work of recent authoritative sources, are unlikely to be the result of progress on outstanding categorical issues, but rather reflect the limited progress on these aspects and/or pressures in regulating the use of the technology."

Research in this area has focused on developing increasingly rigorous techniques using the content. Researchers consider that Content is King and ignore everything else. In this paper, first we will discuss how this infatuation with content continues to be the biggest hurdle in the success of, ironically, content based approaches for multimedia search. Lately, many commercial systems have ignored content in favor of context and demonstrated better success. Given that the mobile phones are the major platform for the next generation of computing, context becomes easily available and more relevant. We show that it is not Content Versus Context; rather it is Content and Context that is required to bridge the semantic gap. In this paper, first we will discuss reasons for our approach and the..."

en,meaningless_content,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00820-y,"The benefits, risks and bounds of personalizing the alignment of large ...","Large language models (LLMs) undergo ‘alignment’ so that they better reflect human values or preferences, and are safer or more useful. However, alignment is intrinsically difficult because the hundreds of millions of people who now interact with LLMs have different preferences for language and conversational norms, operate under disparate value systems and hold diverse political beliefs. Typically, few developers or researchers dictate alignment norms, risking the exclusion or under-representation of various groups. Personalization is a new frontier in LLM development, whereby models are tailored to individuals. In principle, this could minimize cultural hegemony, enhance usefulness and broaden access. However, unbounded personalization poses risks such as large-scale profiling, privacy infringement, bias reinforcement and exploitation of the vulnerable. Defining the bounds of responsible and socially acceptable personalization is a non-trivial task beset with normative challenges. This article explores ‘personalized alignment’, whereby LLMs adapt to user-specific data, and highlights recent shifts in the LLM ecosystem towards a greater degree of personalization. Our main contribution explores the potential impact of personalized LLMs via a taxonomy of risks and benefits for individuals and society at large. We lastly discuss a key open question: what are appropriate bounds of personalization and who decides? Answering this normative question enables users to benefit from personalized alignment while safeguarding against harmful impacts for individuals and society. Tailoring the alignment of large language models (LLMs) to individuals is a new frontier in generative AI, but unbounded personalization can bring potential harm, such as large-scale profiling, privacy infringement and bias reinforcement. Kirk et al. develop a taxonomy for risks and benefits of personalized LLMs and discuss the need for normative decisions on what are acceptable bounds of personalization."

Despite stunning advances in basic science and technology, clinical translations in major areas of medicine are lagging. While the COVID-19 pandemic exposed inherent systemic limitations of the clinical trial landscape, it also spurred some positive changes, including new trial designs and a shift toward a more patient-centric and intuitive evidence-generation system. In this Perspective, I share my heuristic vision of the future of clinical trials and evidence-based medicine. Technological advances are transforming evidence generation in medicine; for these advances to impact public health, the clinical trial landscape must evolve and adapt to keep pace."

The analysis of the changes to waste and material flows only provides a first ‘back of the envelope’ estimate of how the CMUR might change (assuming other parameters remain constant), without implementing a full mass-balancing exercise. The effect of selected (isolated) variations in the underlying parameters of the CMUR indicator should be interpreted as exploratory scenario results. The ambition of the Circular economy action plan of doubling the CMUR within the next decade is understood as moving from a CMUR of 11.7% in 2020 – the year of the adoption of the Action Plan – to 23.4% in 2030 for the EU-27 as a whole."

en,personal_vehicles,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00731-5,The value of car ownership and use in the United States,"It is widely accepted that consumers underestimate the full cost of car ownership and that correcting this bias could meaningfully accelerate the adoption of shared mobility. Yet this argument fails to consider how much benefit consumers enjoy from owning their own vehicle. Here we estimate the value of private car ownership and use in four US metro areas—Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Seattle, Washington; and Washington DC—using online discrete choice experiments. We find that, on average, people would need to be paid $11,197 to give up access to their privately owned vehicle for one year, which is at least as much as estimates of the average total private cost of vehicle ownership (~$9,000). Critically, we find that more than half of this value is non-use value—such as the option to travel whenever or wherever needed at a moment’s notice and the status that comes from owning one’s own vehicle—beyond the use value of getting from A to B. Further, this non-use value was found to be much higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reframe the conversation around the transition away from private vehicle dependence, emphasizing the need to provide value and convenience if alternative mobility solutions are to be widely adopted. A choice experiment shows that perceived benefits of vehicle ownership, including non-use values such as schedule flexibility and status in addition to the transport value, are on average larger than their private costs."

Based on the data from 1965–1966 to 2005–2006 of four-wheelers and two-wheelers, a long-term trend in the growth of personal vehicles is projected up to the year 2020–2021. The logistic model fits well in projecting the growth of four-wheelers, and the Gompertz model is better in the case of two-wheelers. It is found that the total number of personal vehicles will increase from 4.5 million in 2005–2006 to 10.62 million in 2020–2021, with increasing share of four-wheelers. In 2020–2021, the projected growth of personal vehicles will demand nearly double the quantity of petrol in comparison with the level of 2005–2006. Similarly, carbon monoxide emission will increase to 2.5 times more than the 2005 level. The conversion of four-wheelers from petrol engine into compressed natural gas engine will reduce the petrol demand marginally, but carbon monoxide emission will decrease significantly."

James Wilson wrote this book to counter two ideas: that popular interests will automatically generate political organizations and that such organizations will faithfully mirror the opinions and interests of their members. Moreover, he demonstrated that the way in which political organizations (including parties, business groups, labor unions, and civil rights associations) are created and maintained has a profound impact on the opinions they represent and the tactics they use. Now available for the first time in paperback, this book has broadened its scope to include recently developed organizations as it addresses many of today's concerns over the power of such groups as special-interest lobbies. In 1973, when this book was first published, the press and public were fascinated by the social movements of the 1960s, thinking that the antiwar and civil rights movements might sweep aside old-fashioned interest-group lobbies. Wilson argued, however, that such movements would inevitably be supplanted by new organizations, ones with goals and tactics that might direct the course of action away from some of the movements' founding principles. In light of the current popular distress with special-interest groups and their supposed death-grip on Congress, Wilson again attempts to modify a widely held view. He shows that although lobbies have multiplied in number and kind, they remain considerably constrained by the difficulty they have in maintaining themselves."

International Organizations in Global Politics,"This chapter examines the nature of international organizations and their role in global politics. It first explains what an international organization is before discussing the rise of international organizations from a historical perspective, focusing on developments from the nineteenth century onwards. It then considers the major intergovernmental institutions that emerged in the twentieth century and which have made significant contributions in shaping the global order, including the League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations. It also looks at non-governmental organizations and concludes with an analysis of ideas about social movements and global civil society, along with their relationship to the contemporary world of international organizations."

By considering these diverse perspectives, we can develop a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of the political and its role in shaping society."

Here using nearly a billion tweets, we analyse the change in Twitter’s news media landscape between the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Using political bias and fact-checking tools, we measure the volume of politically biased content and the number of users propagating such information. We then identify influencers—users with the greatest ability to spread news in the Twitter network. We observe that the fraction of fake and extremely biased content declined between 2016 and 2020. However, results show increasing echo chamber behaviours and latent ideological polarization across the two elections at the user and influencer levels. Flamino et al. examine changes in the political news media and influencer landscape of Twitter between the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections."

N/A,political_organizations,https://books.google.com/books/about/Political_Organizations.html?id=Mtv2qHkuxDgC,<b>Political Organizations</b> - James Q. Wilson - Google Books,"A major work by one of America's eminent political scientists, Political Organizations has had a profound impact on how we view the influence of interest groups on policymaking. James Wilson wrote this book to counter two ideas: that popular interests will automatically generate political organizations and that such organizations will faithfully mirror the opinions and interests of their members. Moreover, he demonstrated that the way in which political organizations (including parties, business groups, labor unions, and civil rights associations) are created and maintained has a profound impact on the opinions they represent and the tactics they use. Now available for the first time in paperback, this book has broadened its scope to include recently developed organizations as it addresses many of today's concerns over the power of such groups as special-interest lobbies. In 1973, when this book was first published, the press and public were fascinated by the social movements of the 1960s, thinking that the antiwar and civil rights movements might sweep aside old-fashioned interest-group lobbies. Wilson argued, however, that such movements would inevitably be supplanted by new organizations, ones with goals and tactics that might direct the course of action away from some of the movements' founding principles. In light of the current popular distress with special-interest groups and their supposed death-grip on Congress, Wilson again attempts to modify a widely held view. He shows that although lobbies have multiplied in number and kind, they remain considerably constrained by the difficulty they have in maintaining themselves."

Devoted to non-partisan and balanced dialogue, the organization does not adopt positions on political issues; we leave it to our members to make up their own minds and discuss diverse perspectives. We host over 40 events per semester, ranging from informal discussions and social events to formal debates and speaker events. Our membership is 100% inclusive; anyone who wants to join GPA is welcome. GPA consists of four branches: the Polybian Society, the Penn Political Union, the Penn Political Review, and the Forum for Legislative Action.&nbsp;
Polybian Society - Open to all, Polybian consists of weekly symposium discussions around a designated topic. It is a great way to meet new people, enjoy food and drinks while thinking/chatting about politics, share your intellectual opinion, and learn from others!
Penn Political Union - PPU is the formal debate branch that hosts events with student debates, faculty discussions, and prominent speaker events. All of these events are open to everyone and food is usually provided.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interested in helping put these events on? Apply for our PPU Deputy Board
Penn Political Review - PPR is GPA's political publication branch, periodically releasing a publication and online articles from an array of students and faculty members. On top of its full-time editorial staff, PPR has open participation where anyone interested can directly contribute to the original publishing.
Forum for Legislative Action - The Forum is a legislative advocacy program where members spend a year writing an original policy proposal, navigating the legislative process, consulting with legislative offices and partner organizations, and meeting with congressionla staffers to get policy passed. The group strives to create and implement nonpartisan nuts-and-bolts policies at the federal level, a process that includes an annual trip to Washington, D.C. to lobby for the respective policies."

However, knowledge of the PPU lived experience is limited. To address this gap, we conducted an online qualitative study with 67 individuals who self-identified as having problematic pornography use (76% male; Mage = 24.70&nbsp;years, SD = 8.54). Results indicated several dimensions that have not been fully explored in the literature. These included various mental and physical complaints following periods of heavy pornography use, sexual functioning deficits with real partners, and a subjectively altered state of sexual arousal while using pornography. Moreover, we expanded on current knowledge regarding the inner conflict associated with PPU and clarified the ways that users can progress to increasingly intensified patterns of pornography use, such as tolerance/escalation and pornographic binges. Our study highlights the complex and nuanced nature of PPU and provides suggestions for future research and clinical practice."

en,pornography,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41443-023-00812-3,<b>Pornography</b> and sexual function in the post-pandemic period: a ...,"The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns had significant impacts on sexual functioning and behavior. Partnered sexual activity decreased overall, while solo sex activities such as masturbation and pornography consumption increased exponentially. Given the ongoing debate about the effects of pornography on sexual function, it was prudent to consider how the increase in porn consumption during the pandemic might have impacted sexual function in the post-pandemic period. Results indicated that despite the increased rates of use during lockdowns, there remains no evidence supporting the relationship between sexual dysfunction and porn use during and following the pandemic period. On the contrary, pornography consumption and solo sex activities offered an alternative to conventional sexual behavior during a highly stressful period and were found to have positive effects of relieving psychosocial stress otherwise induced by the pandemic. Specifically, those who maintained an active sexual life experienced less anxiety and depression, and greater relational health than those who were not sexually active. It is important to consider factors including frequency, context, and type of consumption when analyzing the impact of pornography on sexual function. While excessive use can have negative effects, moderate use can be a natural and healthy part of life."

en-ZA,pornography,https://www.psychologytoday.com/za/basics/pornography,<b>Pornography</b> | Psychology Today South Africa,"Pornography, or porn, is any sexually explicit material—written, visual, or otherwise—intended to sexually arouse. Pornography has existed for millennia, and today it remains widely available in books, magazines, and audio recordings, but is most readily found and accessed online: The world’s largest porn site claims that in 2018, it had a daily average of 92 million unique viewers, the vast majority of them males."
en,pornography,https://fmch.bmj.com/content/11/1/e001776,<b>Pornography</b> use among adolescents and the role of primary care,"Given the increase in pornography use among adolescents over the years, we discuss the impact of its use on sexual health development as well as the role of primary care providers (PCPs) in assessing use and providing sexual health education. While pornography use is often viewed negatively, it is important to develop unbiased understanding of the use in order to provide non-judgemental, adolescent-focused and educational care. As PCPs are often the first point of contact when adolescents experience medical and behavioural health concerns, it is essential for them to be equipped to screen for pornography use effectively, create a confidential and comfortable environment to talk about pornography use and sexuality, and be informed of ways to promote open discussion between youth and parents. In addition to PCP involvement, parental collaboration, knowledge and comfortability with discussing pornography use with their child are powerful tools in understanding and navigating pornography use in this population. This special communication seeks to provide an objective view of adolescents’ pornography use, guidelines for screening of pornography use and ways to facilitate conversations about the use between adolescents and caregivers."

However, despite clear and compelling evidence for the benefits of high-quality, curriculum-based CSE, few children and young people receive preparation for their lives that empowers them to take control and make informed decisions about their sexuality and relationships freely and responsibly.

Countries are increasingly acknowledging the importance of equipping young people with the knowledge and skills to make responsible choices in their lives, particularly in a context where they have greater exposure to sexually explicit material through the Internet and other media. "

It alters our idea of what it means to start a business. We can get our fix of current events through this medium, share our favorite websites with one another, and capture moments using pictures and video to share with family and friends. There are many positives to consider when looking at the latest form of social networking, but it can also be a world filled with many negatives. You can use websites like Facebook to launch a new business idea, sell products or services, and extend the reach of your brand. These platforms can also become an inescapable place where peer pressure can push people toward choices they would never make without its influence. We look at brands like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram for social networking today, but this communications tool has been everywhere since the early 2000s. Six Degrees earns recognition as being the first official site, founded in 1997 by Andrew Weinreich, with a peak of 1 million members. People were going into AOL chat rooms before then. Friendster then emerged in 2002, a year before LinkedIn, to set the stage for what we see today. The pros and cons of social networking are often more about your priorities when using it and the pages and people with whom you choose to interact. How can you take advantage of these critical viewpoints today? List of the Pros of Social Networking 1. Social networking gives you a chance to connect with people around the world. One of the most obvious advantages of using social networking is the opportunity these websites provide you to reach people from anywhere in the world. As long as there is a connection to the Internet and a profile created, you can become ""friends"" or a ""follower"" of someone and check-in with them at any point in time. Some people use Facebook to stay in touch with family, talk to old high school friends, and share their political feelings. Twitter is a micro-blogging platform that is used for comedy, current events, and general observation. You can even connect with people from places you've never seen or heard of before. 2. This technology gives us access to easy, instant communication tools. Social networking gives us the chance to stay connected with one another wherever we happen to go. You don't need to have access to a landline to call someone with this technology today. Sending a letter through the traditional mail seems like an eternity. Forget about answering machines or voicemail – just leave a comment on someone's page and they'll get a notification about it immediately. When we stay connected to social networking, then all we need to do is pick up our smartphone, boot up the computer, or open the laptop to start communicating with someone. You can even use an app that connects to your profile to take advantage of these benefits no matter where you are in the world. 3. Information happens in real-time blocks on social networks. Before the Internet came around, we all had to wait for the daily newspaper or the news broadcasts on television to know what was going on in the world that day. Even when cable news came around to give us 24/7 access to stories, we had to sit, watch, and wait for the stories we wanted to see. Thanks to social networking, one simple search is all that is necessary to access the current events notifications that we want to see. You can even go a step further and set alerts through your social networking profile so that you receive notifications when a specific page has new information to review. This process allows you to customize your news feed, allowing the information discovery experience to follow the exact path you want. 4. Social networking creates brand exposure for businesses. Any type of professional organization can use their social networking presence to connect with their current and future customers. Most platforms allow businesses to sell their products, either directly on the social media site or through a link to the company's sales page. This process makes it easier to expand the reach of a company through the use of these one-to-one connections that are possible. There are numerous small businesses and entrepreneurs who have thriving companies today which survive almost entirely on what they can create through a social network. Some of the brands would be unable to operate without it. 5. Being on a social network is a lot of fun. The average person in the United States spends between 35 to 45 minutes every day on their favorite social networks. Some might call this behavior an addiction, but it wouldn't be that way if people weren't having fun checking in with others or staying up-to-date on the latest news and information. Humans are naturally social creatures, so it feels satisfying to have likes, hearts, or comments left on a posit. You can create friendly conversations in the comfort of home while seeing what everyone is doing without needing to ask them. 6. Social networks are a useful law enforcement tool. 73% of law enforcement officials in the United States say that they believe social networking sites help them to solve crimes with more speed. 85% of the police departments in the U.S. use social media to investigate local offenses. It is a tool that helps officers track down and arrest those who brag about their crimes online. This advantage has led to numerous prosecutions, including hate crimes, and identified multiple people in videos where inappropriate actions occur so that the proper charges can be brought against them. 7. This tool can help students perform better at school. About 3 out of every 5 students say that they use social media to discuss educational topics if they have access to the Internet. Half of students say that they talk about their school assignments with their friends thanks to the tools offered by these platforms. George Middle School, which is located in Portland, OR, introduce social networking programs to engage their students and found a 50% increase in grades. There were also declines of chronic absences and an increase in the voluntary extra-credit. 8. Social networking helps people who are shy or socially isolated to connect with others. About 1 in 4 teens say that their experiences on social media have helped them to feel less shy when interacting with others in real life. Almost 30% of the young people in that group say that these encounters help them to feel more outgoing, while 1 in 5 say that their confidence got a boost. Some kids, teens, and young adults are not as socially adept as others, which is where the anonymity of social networking can help. This online resource gives them an opportunity to feel more comfortable, become vocal, and practice interactions with other people in a way that creates a safety net for them. 9. The elderly can feel more connected to society because of social media. The Pew Research Center conducted a study in 2015 to see how senior citizens felt about the use of social media. For those in the 65 and older age demographic, which is one of the fastest growing groups on social networks, they felt happier because of the online contacts that were available to them because of this technology. They could talk to their family, see pictures and video of their grandchildren, or access the bulletin from their church. Only 2% of senior citizens were using social networking in 2008. That figure climbed to 35% by 2015 because of this unique advantage. List of the Cons of Social Networking 1. Social networking exposes us to a lot of information. When social networks first started, the platforms became a place of meaningful connection. You would share videos, photographs, and letters with the essential people in your life. Now that there are millions (and sometimes billions) of people on a platform, there can be a lot of white noise that drowns out these conversations. Between the political arguments, posted selfies, shared links, and brand videos that enter the average news feed every day, it becomes pretty overwhelming to have all of this information at a glance. Most people tend to create bloated news feeds with a collected group of friends and followers that contains irrelevant content. It becomes a challenge to stay connected with people because you might lose their conversations in the blizzard of data that social networks have become. 2. There are privacy issues to consider with social networks. Because there is so much data sharing happening with the modern social network, the amount of privacy that we have for the average person is shrinking a little bit every day. The user agreements that you agree to follow when signing up for this service might even create a license which allows the platform to use your content without attribution – including your pictures. You might become a target if you share your current location over social media. Your employer can choose to fire you if they disagree with something that you shared over your network. If you share too much with the public, there could be problems that develop which will never resolve as the information releases. 3. Cyberbullying and peer pressure are significant issues. If you struggle to fit in with your group of peers, then you might feel some pressure to behave or communicate in specific ways to feel accepted. This disadvantage tends to impact teens and young adults the most, but it can also influence anyone. It is not unusual for the negative behaviors to be worse online than at school or work because bullies feel like they can be anonymous when sitting behind a screen or using a smartphone. In extreme cases of this disadvantage, the bullying and negative comments that occur over social networking can lead to anxiety, depression-like symptoms, and high levels of stress. Cyberbullying makes teens and young adults twice as likely to attempt suicide or attempt to harm themselves in other ways. ""Prevention of cyberbullying should be included in school anti-bullying policies, alongside broader concepts such as digital citizenship, online peer support for victims, and how an electronic bystander might appropriately intervene,"" Professor Ann John, of Swansea University Medical School, told The Telegraph. ""Suicide prevention and intervention is essential within any comprehensive anti-bullying program and should incorporate a whole-school approach to include awareness raising and training for staff and pupils."" 4. Some people substitute online interactions for their offline relationships. Our constant connections with one another create a change in how we approach our relationships. You can pull up the social profile of a friend with a simple tap or click. Then you can message that person, leave a comment, or like one of their posts. We often substitute these actions for the face-to-face conversations we used to have, which reduces the number of social skills that we can use outside of the digital realm. Because of this disadvantage, some critics of social networking would say that our activities promote anti-social behavior more than it encourages new connections. 5. Social networking can become a severe distraction for some people. When someone becomes distracted by the information available through social media, it can take them up to 25 minutes to become focused on their original task. Do you check your phone when you wake up in the morning? How often do you scroll through Facebook or Instagram? The time spent on these platforms, along with the time it takes to recover from the distraction, can cost you up to 70 hours of productive time per month. There are some ways that you can limit this disadvantage. Start by turning off notifications on your phone and in your browser. Talk with people instead of pulling out a device to chat on an app. Then give yourself specific times during the day where you check on your profile and news feed instead of going to it multiple times per day. 6. It can disrupt your sleep cycle. When you expose your brain to electronics, then it can change the emphasis of your mind from wanting to go to sleep to staying engaged with social media. The blue light spectrum from some devices can be stimulating as well, but the danger with this disadvantage is that you'll start to think more about what other people are doing or the information on your profile instead of trying to get some rest. 7. Using social networking all of the time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Because social networking typically happens on a mobile device or a computer, it can promote the habit of sitting down in a single spot for too long during the day. Some people check their feeds when they exercise, but it happens more often when there are quiet moments that feel boring. If you're using social media for 70 minutes every day in a seated position, then this habit can start to create changes that lead you toward a sedentary lifestyle. 8. Social networking can spread false or unreliable information quickly. When traditional media reporters were polled about their use of social media, over 78% of them said that they used their platforms to check for breaking news. The problem with this habit is that there tends to be a lack of fact verification before the sharing process happens. People tend to want news that conforms with their beliefs instead of the data being a direct observation of current events. News items that contain inaccuracies spread six times faster on Twitter than articles that contain the truth. Fake news items receive more shares and retweets than true stories. It is up to each of us to verify the information that we share to avoid this disadvantage. 9. Students who use social networking too often have lower grades. About one-third of students say that they are on social media while studying or doing their homework in ways that are not educationally productive. This activity reduces the quality of their work, which often leads to lower grades. Non-users of social networking averaged a GPA of 3.82 in the United States, while those who continued to use Facebook and similar sites had an average GPA of 3.06. Students who use social media sites while studying score up to 20% lower on their tests compared to non-users. For young adults in college or at a university, their grades drop 0.12 points for every 90 minutes they spend on networking sites each day. Four hours of screen time is enough for a student to drop a full grade. 10. Social media creates more time wasting opportunities throughout the day. Internet users between the ages of 16-64 said that they spend about 1.7 hours every day on their various social media sites. That accounts for about 30% of the total amount of time that they spend online each day. One-third of those who were surveyed said that their networking activities were the biggest waste of time in their day, ranking it above watching television, playing fantasy sports, and shopping. 11. The use of social networking is correlated with brain and personality disorders. Research from the University of Pittsburgh finds that the use of social networking sites creates a significant increase in depression and depression-like symptoms for adults between the ages of 19-32. The addictive qualities of these platforms can lead to an enhancement or increase in narcissistic behaviors and personality traits. It may lead to hyperactivity behaviors, resistance to authority figures, and general inattention as well. 12. It can be more difficult to find a job with your social media presence. Not only can you lose a job because of what you decide to share on social networks, but you can also find it more challenging to be offered a position in the first place. Job recruiters and human resource managers say that references to illegal drugs, sexualized content, poor grammar and spelling, and profanity all have a significantly negative impact on their perspective of a potential recruit. Firearms and alcohol are potential red flags on a profile as well. Up to 55% of recruiters today say that they consider hiring an applicant based on what they can see of their social media activities. Verdict on the Pros and Cons of Social Networking Social networking gives us an opportunity to quickly disseminate essential information to the general public. The Department of Veterans Affairs uses this tool as a way to help prevent suicide attempts in veterans' groups after they return from active combat. The World Health Organization used it to combat the spread of false information after the 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan where people were encouraging the ingestion of salt to fight off the effects of radiation. We can use social media to disarm social stigmas. It helps us to stay connected with each other, learn about current events, and share the good things about our lives. The pros and cons of social networking also show us that it can be used to spread hate and bully others. There are about 10,000 tweets every day which contain racial slurs. It can create echo chambers where followers reinforce extreme propaganda within their group, which can lead to radicalization over time. It can also lead to social isolation. That's why we must make healthy choices when using this technology. Social networking can be used for good just as easily as it can be used to harm others."

en,society_and_lifestyles,https://www.unep.org/explore-topics/resource-efficiency/what-we-do/sustainable-lifestyles/why-sustainable-lifestyles,Why Sustainable lifestyles matter - UN Environment Programme,"Sustainable living means understanding how our lifestyle choices impact the world around us and finding ways for everyone to live better and lighter. Applying a ‘people lens’ to sustainability is new, timely and opportunities are great. Sustainable living and lifestyles for the first time appear in the Sustainable Development Goals (4 Education and 12.8 Responsible Consumption). UN Environment Programme is at the forefront of looking into what sustainable lifestyles are and how decision-making can be better harnessed for sustainability. How can governments and business better support and measure change? Most people do not wake up with the intention to harm the environment - nor to help it. People get up and live their lives and strive for aspirations. The amount of stuff people have in many parts of the world has shot up, while in other areas, many struggle to meet basic needs. Our future now depends on our behavior and how we choose to live, work and play as global consumers – how we run our homes, what food we eat, how we get around, how we relax, what we buy and how we care for our planet. People do not change behavior based on what they should do. They do not respond to data and statistics, nor to negative future scenarios. People act to fulfill their needs and aspirations. They make decisions based on price, accessibility, effectiveness and additional criteria like well-being or trends. Sustainability is not the defining criteria. Even the people who want to live more sustainably often lack information and access to affordable and desirable products and services. This underscores that beyond people, it is up to governments and business (who are also consumers!) to provide more information and support positive behavior change, and to support and develop new business models to make sustainable living a default option. UNEP, a long-time proponent of sustainable living and lifestyles, now contributes to the One Planet Network Programme of Sustainable Lifestyles and Education co-led by Sweden and Japan. Our Vision:  To harness individual decision-making for sustainability and integrate sustainable lifestyle principles across society, so that sustainable living, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, becomes the norm (the New Normal) for people everywhere. Who do we work with? Lifestyles cut cross many sectors such as mobility, food, buildings and construction, consumer information, textiles, tourism; they link to efforts such as the One Planet Network and take into account regional and urban differences. Individuals – to enable and motivate them and the organizations that work with people, to make more sustainable lifestyle choices. It’s also about governments and the private sector providing (default) options and systems to meet needs more sustainability. Research institutions and non-governmental organizations – to develop sustainable lifestyle frameworks and future forecasting. By bringing experts together to gather and synthesize data, we support an evidence-base that feeds into education, policy and practice. Educational institutions – to raise awareness and critical thinking to connect how daily living decisions affect the world and people around us. This includes formal and informal education as well as developing evidence-based, climate impactful messages and nature-based solutions and rolling them out through urban initiatives, campaigns and pilot curricula. Governments – to provide guidelines, frameworks and future forecasts, to support the adoption of sustainable policies and improve infrastructure. This advances incentives and options for people to make sustainable lifestyle choices. Cultural influencers, communication and media organizations – to frame messaging in a creative and inspiring way, through new platforms. Media organizations, for instance, can design messaging and advertise them through influencers or documentaries to increase public awareness. Climate activists and cultural influencers are the new ‘policy wild cards’ to embrace."

How we choose to live as a society and as individuals – what houses we choose and build, what food we eat and grow, how we spend our spare time, and what type of transport we use – will have an enormous impact on the trajectory of human history. This publication will help policymakers, individuals and other stakeholders understand what a holistic approach to lifestyle means and how different contexts require different lifestyle solutions. This publication does not set out to define what ""the"" sustainable lifestyle looks like. Instead, it can help guide a range of initiatives that enable lifestyle choices that contribute to sustainability"

Also, the underlying pathways of how lifestyle might affect our health are still under debate. Here, we studied the mediation of different health behaviours or lifestyle factors on mental health and its effect on core markers of ageing: telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA content (mtDNAc). In this study, 6054 adults from the 2018 Belgian Health Interview Survey (BHIS) were included. Mental health and well-being outcomes included psychological and severe psychological distress, vitality, life satisfaction, self-perceived health, depressive and generalised anxiety disorder and suicidal ideation. A lifestyle score integrating diet, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption and BMI was created and validated. On a subset of 739 participants, leucocyte TL and mtDNAc were assessed using qPCR. Generalised linear mixed models were used while adjusting for a priori chosen covariates. The average age (SD) of the study population was 49.9 (17.5) years, and 48.8% were men. A one-point increment in the lifestyle score was associated with lower odds (ranging from 0.56 to 0.74) for all studied mental health outcomes and with a 1.74% (95% CI: 0.11, 3.40%) longer TL and 4.07% (95% CI: 2.01, 6.17%) higher mtDNAc. Psychological distress and suicidal ideation were associated with a lower mtDNAc of − 4.62% (95% CI: − 8.85, − 0.20%) and − 7.83% (95% CI: − 14.77, − 0.34%), respectively. No associations were found between mental health and TL. In this large-scale study, we showed the positive association between a healthy lifestyle and both biological ageing and different dimensions of mental health and well-being. We also indicated that living a healthy lifestyle contributes to more favourable biological ageing."

But for this shift to be effective and for individuals to adopt more sustainable lifestyles, the full participation of educated and motivated citizens is crucial. Through education for sustainable consumption (ESC), individuals learn how to adopt more sustainable lifestyle choices, consume better and more responsibly, seek creative new solutions and engage in policy debates. The world faces numerous challenges, such as financial to environment challenges such as climate change, resource shortages, and the loss of biodiversity. Tackling these challenges requires widespread behavioural change that is needed to shift towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns and the adoption and promotion of sustainable lifestyles. It also involves educating consumers on sustainable consumption and engaging nearly half of the world’s population, namely young people below the age of 25, in efforts to change wasteful consumption patterns into ones that are more attuned to sustainable development.  UNEP’s activities on Education for Sustainable Consumption, Sustainable Lifestyles and Youth are aimed at promoting a rational and responsible use of natural resources, equitable socio-economic development and a better quality of life for all; a pre-requisite to the achievement of sustainable development. UNEP’s initiatives, projects and efforts to educate and promote sustainable consumption and lifestyles are implemented worldwide with the support of different stakeholders including national governments, civil society, business, other UN agencies, consumer organizations, amongst others. Through its activities on ESC, lifestyles and youth, UNEP aims to respond to the need for new cultural and educational models that can foster a new generation of citizens who integrate sustainability in their personal and professional choices and to develop innovative tools to educate, communicate and learn about sustainable consumption."

This study examines the relationship between people’s education levels and sustainable lifestyles in protecting the environment and economic growth, as expressed by the increase in household equivalent income. We conducted an original cross-sectional survey, which yielded 100,956 valid observations in 37 countries. The factors included educational level, sustainable lifestyle with natural resource consumption, and household equivalent income for economic development. We used logit and ordered logit model and applied an ordinary linear regression model after confirming the association between education and income. Our analyses found that higher educational levels were associated with an increase in specific environmentally friendly behaviors and sustainable energy consumption. Individuals in the higher educational level group tended to consume recycled goods, purchase energy-saving household products, conserve electricity, and separate their waste. Additionally, higher levels of education were positively associated with equivalent household income in all 37 countries, indicating better economic development. Thus, our study underscores the importance of improving education at the broad population level to promote economic development and establish cooperative human behaviors necessary to sustain the environment."

However, capitalist social structures have been undergoing transformation in the 21st century. Under a new paradigm emphasizing creativity over functionality and efficiency, the characteristics of everyday life are also changing. We started with the question of apartment spaces, which featured there are only basic minimum functions with simple combinations of similar rooms, without being able to capture the current changed lifestyle. Therefore, this study focuses on newly emerging lifestyles resulting from this transition of social structures and the characteristics of residential spaces at present, centering on the “function of housing”. Based on these considerations, we aimed to establish the essential function of housing that is prioritized by this era. To this end, we first looked at the changes in the functions of housing before and after modern times. We found that the functions of housing that were complex in traditional society have been differentiated and that houses have changed into a more private space along with the post-modern advent of urban public areas. However, the recent shift in social structure has led to the emergence of new lifestyles, which has also called for new functions of housing. Therefore, in this study, through the analysis of recent lifestyle magazines and architectural magazines, we compared the general public’s and architectural experts’ perspectives on the changed functions of housing and the characteristics of the required residential space. Accordingly, this research analyzed articles containing interviews with residents in lifestyle magazines and articles of architects and critics in architectural magazines. In addition to our previous literatures on changes in “characteristics of residents” and “relationship between individual and family”, this study will ignite discussions on contemporary urban housing from diverse and multi-layered levels as an attempt to achieve sustainable housing where residents’ everyday lives and their residential spaces match."

en,society_and_lifestyles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278977/,Social and Environmental Factors Influencing Obesity,"The evidence for social and environmental factors that contribute to obesity are often underappreciated. Obesity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status, which creates complex relationships between each of these characteristics. Food availability remains an important factor associated with obesity that relates to differences in prevalence seen across geographical areas and higher rates of obesity within low socioeconomic status individuals. Proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are or perceived as more affordable combined with reductions in occupational and transportation related physical activity can contribute to a sustained positive energy balance. Additionally, environments experiencing deprivation, disorder, or high crime have been shown to be associated with higher odds of obesity, which may appear more frequently in low social status individuals. Both objective and subjective measures of social status and inequality are associated with increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure, which could place individuals of low social status at greater risk for obesity development. Given the complexity of this multifactorial disease, effective obesity care requires knowledge of these complex relationships and an integration between the health systems and surrounding community. Resources for practicing clinicians regarding methods of screening for social and environmental factors in clinical care are provided in addition to information on a program that has been widely dispersed and made accessible to those who may be the most at risk.

This article reviews its connections with consumption, sometimes referred to as ‘everyday consumption’; and to political action, ‘everyday politics’. It brings together different theoretical and empirical agendas to explore intersections and shifts in ideas around transformation. The first section describes the ways in which everyday life has become associated with consumption, especially through studying practices and their relationship with ecological change. It argues that power, politics and resources are largely absent from these discussions. The second section therefore reviews literature on power, noting that influential theory, including feminist perspectives, practice theory and the work of Michel Foucault, all places emphasis on quotidian situations, interactions and instances, offering ways forward to addressing the absence of power in research on everyday consumption. The third section explores and compares the diverse literature on ‘everyday politics’, lifestyle movements, everyday resistance, prefiguration, life politics and subpolitics. The article groups these and other claims about how the everyday matters for social change into a set of common debates around resources, issues and themes, objects of study, and consequences. This helps identify some notable empirical findings, contrasting analytical claims, and suggests some priorities for future research."

Networking plays leading role to meet day-to-day activities. Huge usage of networking in education systems, financial transactions, businesses, and social gatherings across the globe peaked to the level of spam URL's. In addition to this, the quench for finding most relevant and up-to-date data in any sector lead to severe threat of spam URL's. It's quite difficult to identify the real website from fake one because of spam URL's and thus leads the users to fall under hacker's trick which further threatens the system safety. Therefore, it is worth to classify spam URL's to identify the true websites from fake ones. This led to the emergence of using machine learning techniques to classify Spam URL'S data. In this research, spam URL's data was taken from Kaggle database and machine learning classifiers were used to classify the URL's into spam or non-spam URL's. 10-fold cross validation and hold out method was used. It was observed that random forest yielded high classification accuracy of 97% in classifying the URL data when 10-fold cross validation was performed when compared to hold-out method. Support vector machine yielded 92% classification accuracy followed by naive bayes with a classification accuracy of 91%. The outcomes were assessed on few parameters like accuracy, true positive rate, false positive rate, precision and recall."

But the battle over the future of hunting is not yet resolved, and polarizing right-or-wrong debates continue undiminished. This lively book recounts the long and colorful history of hunting in Britain and offers a fresh perspective on today’s conflicts.   Since William the Conqueror declared wild animals royal property and thereby provoked a burning hatred among his subjects, hunting of all kinds has been a source of social conflict in Britain. The sport is deeply entwined with questions of land and power, class divisions, and social mores. Blood Sport explores these large themes, brings them alive with surprising details and vignettes, and considers how hunting traditions have affected British national identity. Bringing the discussion fully up to date, the book concludes with a thought-provoking critique of current hunting controversies."

Sport hunters, however, achieved ironic results. In proposing that hunting had made Americans great, hunters forgot that Americans had once attributed their greatness to farming. In protecting their sport as a rite of individualism, hunters gave new powers to government. In identifying their sport as a badge of ethnic superiority, hunters undermined hunting as a badge of sexual superiority. In demonstrating their imperial control over the world, hunters demonstrated their fear of a world out of control. At the same time, however, hunters bequeathed to modern Americans an important legacy: the conservation of game."

Sport hunting is an inherently risky strategy for controlling predators as carnivore populations are difficult to monitor and some species show a propensity for infanticide that is exacerbated by removing adult males. Simulation models predict population declines from even moderate levels of hunting in infanticidal species, and harvest data suggest that African countries and U.S. states with the highest intensity of sport hunting have shown the steepest population declines in African lions and cougars over the past 25 yrs. Similar effects in African leopards may have been masked by mesopredator release owing to declines in sympatric lion populations, whereas there is no evidence of overhunting in non-infanticidal populations of American black bears. Effective conservation of these animals will require new harvest strategies and improved monitoring to counter demands for predator control by livestock producers and local communities."

I show that the British sportsmen generally used ideas of fairness in hunting to mark themselves off from the indigenous hunters while colonial frontier officers specifically, through their adeptness in hunting, differentiated themselves from other colonial officers. I argue that ideas of fairness had a different place in the indigenous hunting practices, and often clashed with the 'moral ecology' of the colonial hunters. Using the example of 'palming off', I show how unlike the clash of moral ecologies in relation to hunting practices, the process through which the identities of colonial hunters were constructed was a precarious and contingent one in which indigenous collaboration played a crucial role."

en,sports_hunting_and_war,https://journals.openedition.org/factsreports/1362,Is <b>sport hunting</b> a breakthrough wildlife conservation strategy for ...,"Sport hunting is one of the oldest known recreational activities using wildlife. Some researchers have suggested that sport hunting can benefit the development and economy of local communities, thereby promoting the protection of wildlife resources as well as both ecological and economic sustainability. However, important debates remain regarding the social impacts of conservation and tourism on local communities near protected areas. This study using a case study from northern Cameroon aimed to 1) analyze the social impacts of sport hunting on local people and 2) discuss sustainability of sport hunting. Approximately two years of fieldwork, mainly based on interviews and observations in two villages, showed that sport hunting generated tax revenues of approximately US$1.2 million in one season as well as provided profit sharing and employment opportunities for local communities. However, the local people were affected by regulations of their rights to use natural resources. Moreover, some villages experienced forced migration for the beginning of sport hunting. Many officers and hunting operators insist that sport hunting entails ecological and economic sustainability because it is operated under strict regulations and generates enormous tax revenues. This is in contrast to hunting by local people, who do not consider the hunting regulation nor pay taxes. The question remains, however, whether the term “sustainability” should only encompass ecological and economic factors. Even if sport hunting plays an important role in community conservation, the social impacts on local communities should be considered before the activity is considered as a viable tactic for wildlife conservation.

The Case of Uganda,"After having banned sport hunting in 1979, Uganda reintroduced it in 2001 around Lake Mburo National Park, and in 2006 in the Kabwoya and Kaiso-Tonya Game Management Area, with the aim to reduce human-wildlife conflicts, especially poaching, by providing incentives for the local inhabitants in order to positively change residents' attitudes towards wildlife. We conducted interviews and reviewed documents to analyse and evaluate the impacts of reintroduction of sport hunting. The income generated from sport hunting was used to provide social services and implement social development projects. There was no proof of hunting income being used for conservation purposes. Although the local perceptions of the sport hunting benefits varied, the benefits did initially help to improve local residents' attitudes towards wildlife and poaching temporarily stopped—but resumed later. Hence, this study shows that the common underlying assumption of sport hunting policies and other market- and community-based approaches to conservation—that when local residents receive benefits, they will appreciate wildlife—is debatable."

If you’re on a commute, going on a long trip, or off to places with spotty connections, it’s nice to have something to turn to for entertainment. No need to worry when boredom strikes because you've already thought ahead and downloaded the perfect movie to watch and show to binge.Thankfully, most major streamers have that handy download function, but it's not something inherent to all subscriptions. And even among those that do have that feature, there are certain restrictions. Netflix, for example, reserves downloads for certain titles; even others only allow you to watch offline with lower-resolution options. So in this list, we've gathered the best streaming services that allow downloads. "

en,tobacco,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01210-8,The effects of tobacco control policies on global smoking prevalence,"Substantial global effort has been devoted to curtailing the tobacco epidemic over the past two decades, especially after the adoption of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control1 by the World Health Organization in 2003. In 2015, in recognition of the burden resulting from tobacco use, strengthened tobacco control was included as a global development target in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development2. Here we show that comprehensive tobacco control policies—including smoking bans, health warnings, advertising bans and tobacco taxes—are effective in reducing smoking prevalence; amplified positive effects are seen when these policies are implemented simultaneously within a given country. We find that if all 155 countries included in our counterfactual analysis had adopted smoking bans, health warnings and advertising bans at the strictest level and raised cigarette prices to at least 7.73 international dollars in 2009, there would have been about 100 million fewer smokers in the world in 2017. These findings highlight the urgent need for countries to move toward an accelerated implementation of a set of strong tobacco control practices, thus curbing the burden of smoking-attributable diseases and deaths. Analysis of global smoking prevalence trends from 2009 to 2017 demonstrates that, when implemented, national-level tobacco control policies are highly effective; however, considerable gaps remain in the universal adoption of anti-tobacco interventions."

en,tobacco,https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tobacco-e-cigarettes,Tobacco: E-cigarettes | World Health Organization (WHO),"There are many different types of e-cigarettes, which are the most common type of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery system (ENNDS). These systems heat a liquid to create aerosols that are inhaled by the user. These so-called e-liquids may or may not contain nicotine (but do not contain tobacco). They also typically contain additives, flavours and chemicals that can be harmful to people’s health. E-cigarettes are part of broader products categories of ENDS and ENNDS, which include products such as e-cigars and e-pipes. 

WHO is concerned that these products have been allowed on the open market as consumer products and aggressively marketed to young people. Currently, 88 countries have no minimum age at which e-cigarettes can be bought and 74 countries have no regulations in place for these harmful products. 

E-cigarettes target children through social media and influencers, with at least 16 000 attractive flavours. Some of these products use cartoon characters and have sleek designs, which appeal to the younger generation. Some look like toys and games. There is an alarming increase in use of e-cigarettes among children and young people, with rates exceeding adult use in many countries.
Even brief exposure to e-cigarette content on social media is associated with greater intention to use these products, as well as more positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes."

In 1964, more than 40 percent of the adult population smoked. Once the link between smoking and its medical consequences—including cancers and heart and lung diseases—became a part of the public consciousness, education efforts and public policy changes were enacted to reduce the number of people who smoke. These efforts resulted in substantial declines in smoking rates in the United States—to half the 1964 level.1"

The ease and depth of addiction to nicotine for tobacco users makes quitting extremely difficult and perpetuates the cycle of increased addiction, leading to devastating health effects. Yet tobacco product packaging in most countries provides little or no information to warn consumers of the risks. Tobacco companies use packaging and other advertising techniques to make tobacco seem appealing, while distracting consumers from the harsh reality of how tobacco destroys health. Health warnings on tobacco packaging reach all smokers and cost governments nothing. As laid out in guidelines to Article 11 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, warnings should appear on both the front and back of the packaging and be large and clear and describe specific illnesses caused by tobacco. Use of graphic images demonstrating the harm of tobacco use can be especially effective in convincing users to quit. In addition to paid advertising, reaching out to the news media can effectively and inexpensively disseminate anti-tobacco messaging. "

More than a billion people smoke, and without major increases in cessation, at least half will die prematurely from tobacco-related complications. In addition, people who smoke have a significant reduction in their quality of life. Neurobiological findings have identified the mechanisms by which nicotine in tobacco affects the brain reward system and causes addiction. These brain changes contribute to the maintenance of nicotine or tobacco use despite knowledge of its negative consequences, a hallmark of addiction. Effective approaches to screen, prevent and treat tobacco use can be widely implemented to limit tobacco’s effect on individuals and society. The effectiveness of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions in helping people quit smoking has been demonstrated. As the majority of people who smoke ultimately relapse, it is important to enhance the reach of available interventions and to continue to develop novel interventions. These efforts associated with innovative policy regulations (aimed at reducing nicotine content or eliminating tobacco products) have the potential to reduce the prevalence of tobacco and nicotine use and their enormous adverse impact on population health. This Primer describes the epidemiology, mechanisms, diagnosis and management of tobacco use and tobacco use disorder. Moreover, this Primer discusses the quality of life issues associated with tobacco use and provides an overview of future research avenues for this field."

Persentase penggunaan tembakau pada laki-laki adalah 65,5% dan pada perempuan 3,3%.

en-US,unrated,https://www.imdb.com/list/ls562412052/,"X-RATED, <b>UNRATED</b>, OR NC-17 HORROR, THRILLER, CULT AND GRINDHOUSE ... - IMDb","BIZARRE, unique, eccentric, forgotten, lost as well as transgressive, and equally unconventional cinema from all over the world! A handful of these are definitely not for the squeamish, faint of heart, or those that are easily-offended or overly-sensitive. Nobody under the age of 17 should be permitted (at least for a good chunk of these films). It may sound strange but some of them are somewhat kid or teen friendly in a way and not just for adults so the ratings in general do vary somewhat (depending upon your region or country's rating system I mean). This in particular usually goes for the ones on here that are NR or Unrated.

However for any entry with an R-rating, it is because there is either both an Unrated/R rated edit... more or less, the original X rating was changed after sometime. Which is why I'm also including a handful of films (from all different genres) that were initially rated X or NC-17 when they first came out. Good luck finding some of these though as more than a couple dozen are actually considered to be lost unfortunately! As a side note, a good portion of the movies on here are also banned in multiple countries, if not heavily censored at the very least. Also there are numerous films on here that are simply Not Rated (for whatever reason) and are of all different genres. Not to mention also significantly vary in content, and could considered to be for general audiences, or your average cinema goer... compared to the latter.

Also as an FYI, I honestly haven't seen everything I've included on here just yet so the end result of it may vary from person to person... especially if it is NR/Unrated for whatever reason but please keep an open mind because a handful of some of the best movies are all on this list. Although it should go without saying that most of these films aren't for everyone, but if you do have a strong stomach and a taste for the macabre, provocative, or outlandish then you have come to the right place! Whatever you do, just don't trust the IMDB rating average since it can get pretty misleading and rather inaccurate half the time."

The rapid proliferation of the Internet and the cost-effective growth of its key enabling technologies are revolutionizing information technology and creating unprecedented opportunities for developing largescale distributed applications. At the same time, there is a growing concern over the security of Web-based applications, which are rapidly being deployed over the Internet [4]. For example, e-commerce—the leading Web-based application—is projected to have a market exceeding $1 trillion over the next several years. However, this application has already become a security nightmare for both customers and business enterprises as indicated by the recent episodes involving unauthorized access to credit card information. Other leading Web-based applications with considerable information security and privacy issues include telemedicine-based health-care services and online services or businesses involving both public and private sectors. Many of these applications are supported by workflow management systems (WFMSs) [1]. A large number of public and private enterprises are in the forefront of adopting Internetbased WFMSs and finding ways to improve their services and decision-making processes, hence we are faced with the daunting challenge of ensuring the security and privacy of information in such Web-based applications [4]. Typically, a Web-based application can be represented as a three-tier architecture, depicted in the figure, which includes a Web client, network servers, and a back-end information system supported by a suite of databases. For transaction-oriented applications, such as e-commerce, middleware is usually provided between the network servers and back-end systems to ensure proper interoperability. Considerable security challenges and vulnerabilities exist within each component of this architecture. Existing public-key infrastructures (PKIs) provide encryption mechanisms for ensuring information confidentiality, as well as digital signature techniques for authentication, data integrity and non-repudiation [11]. As no access authorization services are provided in this approach, it has a rather limited scope for Web-based applications. The strong need for information security on the Internet is attributable to several factors, including the massive interconnection of heterogeneous and distributed systems, the availability of high volumes of sensitive information at the end systems maintained by corporations and government agencies, easy distribution of automated malicious software by malfeasors, the ease with which computer crimes can be committed anonymously from across geographic boundaries, and the lack of forensic evidence in computer crimes, which makes the detection and prosecution of criminals extremely difficult. Two classes of services are crucial for a secure Internet infrastructure. These include access control services and communication security services. Access James B.D. Joshi,"
